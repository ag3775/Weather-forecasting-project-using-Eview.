# Weather-forecasting-project-using-Eview.
This project investigates the factors that affect Philadelphia weather temperature and make forecasting for future average weather changes in Philadelphia. Current literature suggests that historical weather are influenced by the Seasons, Air Pressure, and some risk factors. Using daily data for the sample period from 2018/01/01 to 2019/11/30, this project estimates two types of models: time series model and regression model. The time series model is to extract the historical pattern to forecast future Average Temperature changes. The regression model is to link the temperature change to some independent variables.  The time series analysis suggests that the Avg Temp change series follows an autocorrelation process with 10 month lag.  The evidence from the regression model indicates that the change in temperature  is positively correlated with the  change in the Q2 & Q3 and negatively correlated with change of average wind speed (-1), average wind direction(-1), average wind speed (-1), and Q1. The root of mean squared error suggests that the regression model (5.498) outperforms the time series model (17.808).
